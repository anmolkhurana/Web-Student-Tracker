# Web-Student-Tracker
JAVA, JDBC, JSTL, JSP, HTML, CSS, MySql, SERVLET, MVC  

Introduction:

This project basically allows one to understand the MVC architecture that is running in the real world scenarios. I have used JAVA, JSP, 
JSTL and SERVLETS to create a web app that keeps a track of the students. I have used connection pool concept in this project. Focusing on 
core JSP, conncetion pool concepts and JSTL helped me a lot to know stuff that goes in to the real world programming.

Functionalities:

ADD a record
UPDATE a record
DELETE a record

Points to be noted:

There are 2 sql scripts that you have to run in Mysql. This will create a table 'student' table for you and will add data to it. 

Future work:

SEARCH command can be still be added.
